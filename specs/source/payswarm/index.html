The PaySwarm Web platform is an open web standard that enables Web browsers and 
Web devices to perform Universal Web Payment. PaySwarm enables the people that 
create digital content such as blog posts, music, film, episodic content, 
photos, virtual goods, and documents to distribute their creations through 
their website and receive payment directly from their fans and customers. The 
technology is designed to be integrated directly into blogging platforms, 
content management systems and websites in general. The standard handles the
entire content distribution lifecycle, from asset description, to product
listings, to licenses, contracts and financial transactions. Support is
provided for individual sales, subscriptions and micropayments.
      </p> 
    </section> 

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
The PaySwarm Web platform is an open web standard that enables Web browsers and 
Web devices to perform Universal Web Payment. PaySwarm enables the people that 
create digital content such as blog posts, music, film, episodic content, 
photos, virtual goods, and documents to distribute their creations through 
their website and receive payment directly from their fans and customers. The 
technology is designed to be integrated directly into blogging platforms, 
content management systems and websites in general.      
      </p>
      <p>
The technology is provided as an open web platform, which is a combination of 
technology that is patent-free, royalty-free, published in a free 
specification, using well-defined protocols and other open technologies. The 
entire PaySwarm standard, like HTML, HTTP, and JavaScript, is an open web 
platform. Almost every successful Web technology is built and released in 
this way.
      </p>      
      <p>
PaySwarm supports Micropayments. The standard assumes that customers do not
want to be bothered to reach for their wallet every time they need to spend a 
couple of cents, or even a couple of dollars. Micropayment in this case, 
specifically refers to the ability to automatically distribute payments in 
increments of up to 1/100,000th of a cent to anybody listed in PaySwarm 
digital contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
It is the goal of this specification to create an environment that is friendly
to content creators and customers alike. Distribution of digital goods is
becoming an increasing part of the Web and therefore compensation for these
digital goods must be as easy to perform as downloading the digital goods. The
PaySwarm specification works with the architecture of the Web to deliver a
solution that is universal across websites, industries and countries.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Conceptual Model</h2>
      <p>
There are three primary participants in a PaySwarm transaction; the 
asset acquirer, the asset owner, and the PaySwarm Authority.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Identity and Identifiers</h3>
        <p>
In order for a universal payment system to work seamlessly, there must be a
universal way of identifying <em>things</em> in the environment. This 
specification uses Internationalized Resource Identifiers [[!IRI]] to 
refer to <em>things</em> on the network. These things can be identity 
information (<code>https://example.com/people/bob</code>), 
financial account information 
(<code>https://example.com/people/bob/accounts/42</code>), public cryptography
keys (<code>https://example.com/people/bob/keys/14</code>), assets, licenses 
and a variety of other long-lived information that exists on the Web. By naming 
these things with long-lived unique identifiers, it becomes possible to create 
a decentralized but stable universal payment architecture.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Participants</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>Asset Acquirers</h3>
          <p>
An asset acquirer, more commonly known as a buyer, is an entity that is capable 
of acquiring the rights to a particular asset via a Contract. The entity is 
typically a person or an organization that would like to view, copy or 
otherwise utilize the asset that is being acquired.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Asset Providers</h3>
          <p>
An asset provider, more commonly known as an owner, is the entity providing an 
asset for sale. Typically, the asset provider is the legal owner of the asset 
that is being listed for sale. Ownership of an asset can manifest in a variety 
of different forms. Copyright ownership, physical ownership, and sub-leased 
property or services are just a few of the types of ownership that apply to 
asset providers.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>PaySwarm Authorities</h3>
          <p>
A PaySwarm authority is used to store money, process and store contracts, and 
transfer monetary amounts between financial accounts. While PaySwarm 
authorities may hold a great deal of financial data, they are built with
data portability in mind. PaySwarm participants may move their money and
purchase history from one authority to another. Data portability is a mandatory
part of this specification.
          </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Commerce Model</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>Assets</h3>
An asset describes a particular item that is provided as a part of a commercial
transaction. It is usually an item that can be accessed or acquired on the
basis of a sale or rental under the terms of a particular license. Examples
of assets include web pages, music files, video streams, use of virtual
machines by the hour, 3D printer files for on-demand manufacturing, radio 
spectrum and many other items that are capable of being transacted.
          <p>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Licenses</h3>
          <p>
A license is a legal description of a licensee's rights to a particular Asset.
Licenses are usually included as a part of a contract to express what a buyer 
may do with the asset that has been purchased.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Listings</h3>
          <p>
A Listing describes the combination of an Asset that is for sale under a 
specific License and a set of payment terms that must be fulfilled in order 
to access the Asset. Listings are often published on websites that sell assets
via PaySwarm as a way to express wares for sale in a decentralized manner.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Contracts</h3>
          <p>
A contract is the result of a commercial transaction in PaySwarm and contains
information such as the Listing, the Asset that was purchased, the parties 
involved in the transaction, the License outlining the rights to the 
Asset, and payment information associated with the transaction.
          </p>
        </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Base Technologies</h2>
      <p>
PaySwarm builds on a number of successful Internet and Web technologies. These
technologies are introduced in this section.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Representational State Transfer</h3>
        <p>
REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is the architectural style that underpins
the World Wide Web. It consists of a set of constraints to ensure that servers,
gateways, proxies and clients may interact in a way that is predictable.
Systems that are designed with this architecture in mind are called RESTful
systems. PaySwarm is designed to be RESTful by ensuring that the constraints of
REST are applied to all transactions performed via PaySwarm systems.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>JavaScript Object Notation</h3>
        <p>
JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data (JSON-LD) is a lightweight Linked 
Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines 
to parse and generate. It is based on the already successful JSON format and 
provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale. If you are already 
familiar with JSON, writing JSON-LD is very easy. There is a smooth migration 
path from the JSON you use today, to the JSON-LD you will use in the future. 
These properties make JSON-LD an ideal Linked Data interchange language for 
JavaScript environments, Web services, and JSON document-based databases.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Advanced Encryption Standard</h3>
        <p>
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a world standard adopted by the
United States government and used to secure a vast majority of the
commercial transactions over the Internet via OpenSSL. Since much of the data
exchanged over PaySwarm participants is sensitive, it is important that a 
strong cryptography suite is utilized to transfer the messages.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>HTML+RDFa</h3>
        <p>
Web sites are largely implemented on top of the HyperText Markup Language 
(HTML). This format is known to be fairly easy to author and publish on the Web.
In addition to being easy to publish, it is also important that data published
via HTML can be easily read by machines without placing an undue burden on
Web authors. Publishing structured data in a decentralized manner also 
requires a language that is capable of being both expressive and deterministic. 
The Resource Description Framework in attributes (RDFa) extends HTML to allow 
structured data to be expressed via HTML, but in a way that is easy for
Web developers to create.
        </p>

    <section>
      <h2>The Purchase Process</h2>
      <p>
      </p>
      
      <section>
        <h3>Publishing an Asset</h3>
        <p>
An asset describes a particular item that is provided as a part of a commercial
transaction. It is usually an item that can be accessed or acquired on the
basis of a sale or rental under the terms of a particular license. Examples
of assets include web pages, music files, video streams, use of virtual
machines by the hour, 3D printer files for on-demand manufacturing, radio 
spectrum and many other items that are capable of being transacted.
        </p>

        <p>
The following example describes a web page asset with the title "PaySwarm
in Practice - Full Article #1". The article was created by "Digital Bazaar, 
Inc." and the information in the asset is valid from November 28th, 2010 to
November 28th, 2011. The asset is digitally signed by the person providing it
and thus can be cached, stored and then presented to someone else in a manner
that is verifiable by the receiving party.

   }
}
        </pre>
        
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Publishing a License</h3>
        <p>
A license is a legal description of a licensee's rights to a particular Asset.
Licenses are usually included as a part of a contract to express what a buyer 
may do with the asset that has been purchased.
        </p>
        
        <p>
The following example describes an overly-simplified personal use license.
        </p>
        <pre class="example">
{
   "@": "&lt;http://payswarm.example.com/licenses/personal-use>",
   "a": "&lt;ps:License>",
   "dc:format": "text/html",
   "ps:licenseTemplate": "This personal use license allows you to save the 
      purchased item onto any device that you own for your personal enjoyment
      and make up to &ltspan property=\"ex:physicalCopies\" /> printed
      copies of the work for personal use."
   "ps:licenseTerms": 
   {
      "ex:physicalCopies": 5
   }
}
        </pre>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Publishing a Listing</h3>

        <p>
A <a href="#Listing">Listing</a> describes the combination of an <a href="#Asset">Asset</a> that is for sale under a 
specific <a href="#License">License</a> and a set of payment terms that must be fulfilled in order 
to access the Asset. Listings are often published on websites that sell assets
via PaySwarm as a way to express wares for sale in a decentralized manner.
        </p>

        <p>
The following example describes an asset for sale for $0.05 USD under a license
that covers acceptable use of blog posts. The offer is valid from March 2nd 
2011 to March 3rd 2011. The only restriction on additional payees is that the 
PaySwarm Authority (the organization processing the payment) may only take a 
maximum of 10% of the final sale price to cover their fees.
        </p>

        <p>
A contract is the result of a commercial transaction in PaySwarm and contains
information such as the <a href="#Listing">Listing</a>, 
the <a href="#Asset">Asset</a> that was purchased, the parties involved in the
transaction, the <a href="#License">License</a> outlining the rights to the 
Asset, and payment information associated with the transaction.

      <h2>Data Portability</h2>
      <p>
One of the freedoms that is ensured by this specification is the freedom to
own your data and move it to a PaySwarm Authority of your choosing. That is,
your transaction history is your property and therefore you must be able to
move it to a location of your choosing at will. In order to ensure that this
freedom is protected, data portability MUST be implemented by all conforming 
implementations of this specification.
