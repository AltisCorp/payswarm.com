The PaySwarm Web platform is an open web standard that enables Web browsers and 
Web devices to perform Universal Web Payment. PaySwarm enables the people that 
create digital content such as blog posts, music, film, episodic content, 
photos, virtual goods, and documents to distribute their creations through 
their website and receive payment directly from their fans and customers. The 
technology is designed to be integrated directly into blogging platforms, 
content management systems and general purpose websites. The standard can
be applied to the entire content distribution lifecycle, from asset description, 
to product listings, to licenses, contracts and financial transactions. 
Features include the ability to exchange money, transact individual sales, 
subscriptions and micropayments.

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
The PaySwarm Web platform is an open web standard that enables Web browsers and 
Web devices to perform Universal Web Payment. PaySwarm enables the people that 
create digital content such as blog posts, music, film, episodic content, 
photos, virtual goods, and documents to distribute their creations through 
their website and receive payment directly from their fans and customers. The 
technology is designed to be integrated directly into blogging platforms, 
content management systems and general purpose websites.
      </p>
      <p>
The technology is provided as an open web platform, which is a combination of 
technology that is patent-free, royalty-free, published in a free 
specification, using well-defined protocols and other open technologies. The 
entire PaySwarm standard, like HTML, HTTP, and JavaScript, is an open web 
platform. Almost every successful Web technology is built and released in 
this way.
      </p>      
      <p>
PaySwarm supports Micropayments. The standard assumes that customers do not
want to be bothered to reach for their wallet every time they need to spend a 
couple of cents, or even a couple of dollars. Micropayment in this case, 
specifically refers to the ability to automatically distribute payments in 
increments of up to 1/100,000th of a cent to anybody listed in PaySwarm 
digital contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
It is the goal of this specification to create an environment that is friendly
to content creators and customers alike. Distribution of digital goods is
becoming an increasing part of the Web and therefore compensation for these
digital goods must be as easy to perform as downloading the digital goods. The
PaySwarm specification works with the architecture of the Web to deliver a
solution that is universal across websites, industries and countries.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Conceptual Model</h2>
      <p>
There are three primary participants in a PaySwarm transaction; the 
asset acquirer, the asset owner, and the PaySwarm Authority.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Identity and Identifiers</h3>
        <p>
In order for a universal payment system to work seamlessly, there must be a
universal way of identifying <em>things</em> in the environment. This 
specification uses Internationalized Resource Identifiers [[!IRI]] to 
refer to <em>things</em> on the network. These things can be a personal identity 
(<code>https://example.com/people/bob</code>), 
financial account information 
(<code>https://example.com/people/bob/accounts/42</code>), public cryptography
keys (<code>https://example.com/people/bob/keys/14</code>), assets, licenses 
and a variety of other pieces of long-lived information that exists on the Web. 
By naming these things with long-lived unique identifiers, it becomes possible 
to create a decentralized but stable universal payment architecture.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Participants</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>Asset Acquirers</h3>
          <p>
An <tdef>asset acquirer</tdef>, more commonly known as a buyer, is an entity 
that is capable 
of acquiring the rights to a particular asset via a Contract. The entity is 
typically a person or an organization that would like to view, copy or 
otherwise utilize the asset that is being acquired.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Asset Providers</h3>
          <p>
An <tdef>asset provider</tdef>, more commonly known as an owner, is the entity 
providing an asset for sale. Typically, the asset provider is the legal owner 
of the asset that is being listed for sale. Ownership of an asset can manifest 
in a variety of different forms. Copyright ownership, physical ownership, and 
sub-leased property or services are just a few of the types of ownership that 
apply to asset providers.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>PaySwarm Authorities</h3>
          <p>
A <tdef>PaySwarm Authority</tdef> is used to store money, process and store 
contracts, and 
transfer monetary amounts between financial accounts. While a PaySwarm 
Authority may hold a great deal of financial data, they are built with
data portability in mind. PaySwarm participants may move their money and
purchase history from one authority to another. Data portability is a mandatory
part of this specification.
          </p>

      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Commerce Model</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>Assets</h3>
An <tdef>asset</tdef> describes a particular item that is provided as a part 
of a commercial
transaction. It is usually an item that can be accessed or acquired on the
basis of a sale or rental under the terms of a particular license. Examples
of assets include web pages, crowd-funded loans or grants, music files, 
video streams, use of virtual machines by the hour, 
3D printer files for on-demand manufacturing, radio 
spectrum and many other items that are capable of being transacted.
          <p>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Licenses</h3>
          <p>
A <tdef>license</tdef> is a legal description of a licensee's rights to a 
particular <tref>asset</tref>.
Licenses are usually included as a part of a contract to express what a buyer 
may do with the asset that has been purchased.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Listings</h3>
          <p>
A <tdef>listing</tdef> describes the combination of an <tref>asset</tref> that 
is for sale under a specific <tref>license</tref> and a set of payment terms 
that must be fulfilled in order 
to access the <tref>asset</tref>. Listings are often published on websites that 
sell <tref>assets</tref> via PaySwarm as a way to express wares for sale in a 
decentralized manner.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Contracts</h3>
          <p>
A <tdef>contract</tdef> is the result of a commercial transaction in PaySwarm 
and contains
information such as the <tref>listing</tref>, the <tref>asset</tref> that was 
purchased, the parties involved in the transaction, the <tref>license</tref> 
outlining the rights to the <tref>asset</tref>, and payment information 
associated with the transaction.

      <h2>Base Technologies</h2>
      <p>
PaySwarm builds on a number of successful Internet and Web technologies. These
technologies are introduced in this section.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Representational State Transfer</h3>
        <p>
REpresentational State Transfer [[REST]] is the architectural style that underpins
the World Wide Web. It consists of a set of constraints to ensure that servers,
gateways, proxies and clients may interact in a way that is predictable.
Systems that are designed with this architecture in mind are called RESTful
systems. PaySwarm is designed to be RESTful by ensuring that the constraints of
REST are applied to all transactions performed via PaySwarm systems.

        <h3>JavaScript Object Notation for Linking Data</h3>
        <p>
JavaScript Object Notation for Linking Data [[!JSON-LD]] is a lightweight Linked 
Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines 
to parse and generate. It is based on the already successful JSON format and 
provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale. If you are already 
familiar with JSON, writing JSON-LD is very easy. There is a smooth migration 
path from the JSON you use today, to the JSON-LD you will use in the future. 
These properties make JSON-LD an ideal Linked Data interchange language for 
JavaScript environments, Web services, and JSON document-based databases.

        <h3>The Advanced Encryption Standard</h3>
        <p>
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [[!FIPS-197]] is a world standard 
adopted by the
United States Government and used to secure a vast majority of the
commercial transactions over the Internet via OpenSSL. Since much of the data
exchanged over PaySwarm participants is sensitive, it is important that a 
strong cryptography suite is utilized to digitally sign and transfer the 
messages.

        <h3>HTML+RDFa</h3>
        <p>
Web sites are largely implemented on top of the HyperText Markup Language 
(HTML). This format is known to be fairly easy to author and publish on the Web.
In addition to being easy to publish, it is also important that data published
via HTML can be easily read by machines without placing an undue burden on
Web authors. Publishing structured data in a decentralized manner also 
requires a language that is capable of being both expressive and deterministic. 
The Resource Description Framework in attributes [[!RDFA-CORE]] extends HTML 
[[!HTML-RDFA]] to allow structured data to be expressed via HTML, but in a way 
that is easy for Web developers to author.

      <h2>The Registration Process</h2>
      <p>The registration process is necessary in order to specify details about
the participants in a PaySwarm transaction.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Registration Terms</h2>
        <p>
There are a number of terms that are used during the course of the registration
process.
        <dl>
        <dt><tdef>publishing agent</tdef></dt>
        <dd>A software agent acting on behalf of the <tref>asset provider</tref>
that publishes <tref>asset</tref>s for sale. Typically, this is blogging
software, content distribution software, online merchant software or a
game of some kind.</dd>
        <dt><tdef>configuration service</tdef></dt>
        <dd>A Web service that is used to publish the public Web service
end-points and other public configuration information for a
<tref>PaySwarm Authority</tref>. A <tref>PaySwarm Authority</tref> MUST
publish this service at a top-level IRI named <code>payswarm-v1-config</code>. 
The document MUST be available in JSON-LD compacted form and MUST use the
<code>http://purl.org/payswarm/v1</code> JSON-LD context. The following
keys MUST be present in the published document; 
<code>public-key-service</code>, <code>license-service</code>, and
<code>contracts-service</code>.</dd>
        <dt><tdef>public key service</tdef></dt>
        <dd>An interactive Web service used to register PEM-encoded 
X.509 public keys with the <tref>PaySwarm Authority</tref>.</dd>
        <dt><tdef>license service</tdef></dt>
        <dd>A utility service is used by a <tref>publishing agent</tref>s 
to retrieve license hashes, which are used when listing <tref>asset</tref>s 
for sale.</dd>
        <dt><tdef>contracts service</tdef></dt>
        <dd>The contract service is used to process purchases by submitting
and retrieving digital contracts.</dd>
        </dl>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Asset Acquirer Registration</h2>
        <p>
In order for an <tref>asset acquirer</tref> to transact, they must have an
account on a <tref>PaySwarm Authority</tref>. Typically, this account must 
also contain a positive amount of funds that may be used to acquire goods or 
services. How this account is created and funds are deposited are outside of
the scope of this specification. However, the end result of this sign up
process MUST result in the following items being created for the
<tref>asset acquirer</tref>:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>An <tdef>entity</tdef> IRI that will be used to identify the 
entity that is transacting. For example: 
<code>https://example.com/people/jane</code>.</li>
          <li>A <tdef>financial account</tdef> IRI that is associated with the 
<tref>entity</tref> IRI above. For example:
<code>https://example.com/people/jane/accounts/primary</code>.</li>
          <li>A positive amount of funds in the <tref>financial account</tref>
mentioned above.
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Asset Provider Registration</h2>
        <p>
In order for an <tref>asset provider</tref> to transact, they must have an
account on a PaySwarm Authority. How this account is created and managed is
outside of the scope of this specification. However, the end result of this
sign up process MUST result in the following items being created for the 
<tref>asset provider</tref>:
        </p>
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>An <tdef>entity</tdef> IRI that will be used to identify the 
entity that is transacting. For example: 
<code>https://example.com/people/manu</code>.</li>
          <li>A <tdef>financial account</tdef> IRI that is associated with the 
<tref>entity</tref> IRI above. For example:
<code>https://example.com/people/manu/accounts/article-sales</code>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
Since all <tref>asset</tref>s and <tref>listing</tref>s are digitally signed,
a public key MUST be registered for the 
<tref>asset provider</tref> with the <tref>PaySwarm Authority</tref>.
This is typically performed by the <tref>publishing agent</tref> software that 
is publishing the 
<tref>asset</tref>s and <tref>listing</tref>s for sale on behalf of the 
<tref>asset provider</tref>. The registration is accomplished by executing
the following algorithm:
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>The <tref>publishing agent<tref> generates and stores a 
public/private keypair that will be used to associate the
<tref>publishing agent</tref> with the <tref>asset provider</tref>.</li>
          <li>The <tref>publishing agent</tref> retrieves the 
<tref>PaySwarm Authority</tref> configuration from a configuration IRI, given
a base IRI to the <tref>PaySwarm Authority</tref>.
            <ol class="algorithm">
              <li>The configuration IRI is generated by concatenating a base 
IRI, such as <code>https://example.com/</code> with the 
<code>payswarm-v1-config</code> suffix. 
For example, the previous base IRI concatenated with the configuration
suffix would result in the following configuration
IRI: <code>https://example.com/payswarm-v1-config</code>.</li>
              <li>An HTTP GET is performed on the configuration IRI with the
HTTP <code>Accept</code> header set to <code>application/ld+json</code>. The
<tref>PaySwarm Authority</tref> MUST respond with a compacted JSON-LD document
using the context specified at <code>http://purl.org/payswarm/v1</code></li>
              <li>The result MUST be a JSON-LD document containing a flat set of
key-value pairs. The public-key registration IRI is identified by the
<code>public-key-service</code> key in the JSON-LD document. The value will be 
the <tref>public key service</tdef> IRI.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
The <tref>publishing agent</tref> initiates an HTTP redirect
for the <tref>user agent</tref>. An HTTP GET request is performed
to the <tref>public key service</tref> IRI with the addition of two IRI query 
parameters. The first parameter, <code>public-key</code>, is the X.509 
PEM-encoded public key. The second parameter, 
<code>registration-callback</code>,
is the registration callback IRI for the <tref>publishing agent</tref>.</li>
          <li>
The <tref>PaySwarm Authority</tref> associates the 
<tref>publishing agent</tref> with the <tref>asset provider</tref> based on the
provided public key. Note that is process MUST authenticate the 
<tref>asset provider</tref> via a login process if the 
<tref>asset provider</tref> does not have an active login session. Other
configuration steps may be performed at this stage, including the 
specification of defaults for the particular <tref>publishing agent</tref>.</li>
          <li>
The <tref>PaySwarm Authority</tref> specifies a set of 
<tref>publishing agent</tref> configuration values and, using the provided
public key, encrypts and base-64 encodes the value. The result is sent 
back to the <code>registration-callback</code> IRI via an HTTP POST.
            <ol class="algorithm">
              <li>The following configuration values MUST be included in the
JSON-LD response data to the <tref>publishing agent</tref>; 
<code>public-key-service</code>, <code>license-service</code>, and
<code>contracts-service</code>.
              </li>
              <li>The JSON-LD response is compacted and encrypted using the
public key associated with the registration request. The encrypted byte stream
is then base-64 encoded.</li>
              <li>The base-64 encoded byte stream is transmitted to the
<code>registration-callback</code> via an HTTP POST request that is initiatited
by the <tref>user agent</tref>. This is most commonly accomplished by having
the <tref>PaySwarm Authority</tref> generate an HTML form that can be submitted
to the <tref>publishing agent</tref> when a form submission button is clicked
via the <tref>user agent</tref>.
              <li>The <tref>publishing agent</tref> decrypts the base-64
encoded byte stream, extracts the configuration values and stores each value
for use during the latter parts of the publishing and purchase process.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Publishing an Asset</h3>
        <p>
An <tref>asset</tref> describes a particular item that is provided as a part 
of a commercial transaction. It is usually an item that can be accessed or 
acquired on the
basis of a sale or rental under the terms of a particular <tref>license</tref>. 
Examples of assets include web pages, music files, video streams, use of virtual
machines by the hour, 3D printer files for on-demand manufacturing, radio 
spectrum and crowd-funded loans and grants.
        </p>

        <p>
The following example describes a web page <tref>asset</tref> with the title 
"PaySwarm in Practice - Full Article #1". The article was created by 
"Digital Bazaar, Inc." and the information in the asset is valid from 
November 28th, 2010 to November 28th, 2011. 
The asset is digitally signed by the person providing it
and thus can be cached, stored and then presented to someone else in a manner
that is verifiable by the receiving party.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Publishing a License</h3>
        <p>
A <tref>license</tref> is a legal description of a licensee's rights to a 
particular <tref>asset</tref>.
Licenses are usually included as a part of a contract to express what a buyer 
may do with the asset that has been purchased.
        </p>
        
        <p>
The following example describes an overly-simplified personal use license.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Publishing a Listing</h3>

        <p>
A <tref>listing</tref> describes the combination of an <tref>asset</tref> 
that is for sale under a specific <tref>license</tref> and a set of payment 
terms that must be fulfilled in order to access the asset. Listings are often 
published on websites that sell assets via PaySwarm as a way to express things
that are for sale, in a decentralized manner.
        </p>

        <p>
The following example describes an <tref>asset</tref> for sale 
for $0.05 USD under a <tref>license</tref>
that covers acceptable use of blog posts. The offer is valid from March 2nd 
2011 to March 3rd 2011. The only restriction on additional payees is that the 
<tref>PaySwarm Authority</tref> (the organization processing the payment) 
may only take a maximum of 10% of the final sale price to cover their fees.
        </p>

      <h2>Data Portability</h2>
      <p>
One of the freedoms that is ensured by this specification is the freedom to
own your data and move it to a PaySwarm Authority of your choosing. That is,
your transaction history is your property and therefore you must be able to
move it to a location of your choosing at will. In order to ensure that this
freedom is protected, data portability MUST be implemented by all conforming 
implementations of this specification.
