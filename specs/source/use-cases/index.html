The PaySwarm web platform is an open standard that enables web browsers and web 
devices to perform micropayments and copyright-aware, peer-to-peer digital 
media distribution. This document is a list of all use cases that the 
PaySwarm specification is designed to address.
      </p> 
    </section> 
    <section> 
      <h2>Introduction</h2> 
      <p>
The Web continues to transform the way humankind communicates and builds
our world. At the heart of most of these endeavors is the exchange of
value. Gifts, attention, and payments each play a role in the ecosystem
that we call the economy. Until now, there has been no open and
universal way of sending and receiving payments on the Web through your
browser. This is why people are still compelled to reach for their
credit card or log into a payment site when purchasing something over
the Web.
      </p>
      <p>
There are a number non-interoperable payment solutions today. This
document outlines use cases that are supported by existing payment
solutions today, and also outlines innovative use cases that could be
supported in the future by a universal payment mechanism to enable next
generation mobile payments, alternative currencies, crowd-sourced
investing, next-generation banking, and electronic commerce.
      </p>
      <p>
This specification outlines use cases that are enabled by universal
payment for the Web. The goal of addressing the use cases as a whole is
to create a safe, decentralized system and a set of open, patent and
royalty-free specifications that allow people on the Web to send each
other money as easily as they exchange instant messages and e-mail
today. Addressing these scenarios will transform the way we reward each
other on the Web as well as how we organize financial resources to
enhance our personal lives and pursue endeavors that improve upon the
human condition.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>PaySwarm 1.0 Use Cases</h2>
      <p>
The following use cases outline scenarios that are targeted to be supported
in the set of PaySwarm 1.0 specifications.
      </p>
    
    <section>
      <h2>For-Profit Content Blogging</h2>
 
<p>Jude blogs about music and movies and has achieved a respectable
following of people that read his blog. He would like to sell content that
he writes about to his many readers, but doesn't have the music and movie
industry connections to acquire content for distribution. Typically,
content deals require an multi-million dollar, advance payment in return
for the right to sell content. This high up-front cost removes many
potential sellers, harming the overall incentive to distribute for people
that run smaller music websites and blogs.</p> 

<p>There are many existing clearing houses for content on the web today. If
those clearing houses were able to manage artist content, content creators
could use the clearing house to setup the distribution rights for their
content. Smaller content distributors, like Jude, could then offer content
to their site visitors without worrying about the high-cost or management
overhead associated with managing content catalogs.</p> 
    
    <section>
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>The content distributor (blogger) can be a separate entity from
        content owner (musician/label/production company).</li> 
     
        <li>The content distributor must be able to distribute content without
        the content owners knowledge as long as the distribution license and
        royalty payments are respected.</li> 
     
        <li>The content distributor must be able to set distribution prices
        independently of the content provider.</li> 
     
        <li>The content owner must be able to set base royalties independently of
        the content distributor.</li> 
      </ul> 
    </section>
  </section>
  
  <section> 
    <h2>Streaming Content Payment</h2> 
 
<p>Tellulah is a DJ and would like to setup a non-profit Internet radio
station to stream Weekly Top 40 songs along with a mix of independent
music. She would like to cover her expenses as well as the standard
per-song ephemeral broadcasting fee set by the US Copyright Arbitration
Panel to ensure she is legally compliant at all times. Registering and
tracking royalties can be a very daunting and time consuming process. A
mechanism that reduces the burden of legal compliance could drive more
stations to come online.</p> 

<p>Online radio broadcasters are also presently limited in their ability to
grow their stations due to the ephemeral broadcasting royalties that must
be paid on a per person/per song basis. Running these stations make it
difficult to collect, track and distribute royalties in a way that makes it
easy to integrate into the web browser. Often, donating or signing up to a
single download provider can be more trouble than it is worth. If there was
a universal mechanism to pay very small amounts for data streams on the
Web, new legal avenues for distributing content legally would be
enabled.</p> 

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>Payment must be able to be associated with a section of a stream of
        data. Payment should be allowed to be associated with a particular number
        of bytes or temporal time frame.</li> 
     
        <li>Small fractions of whole currency amounts should be allowed in order
        to ensure accurate metering and payment recouping for content
        streams.</li> 
      </ul>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section> 
    <h2>Crowd-funding Initiatives</h2> 
 
    <p>
Dione would like to raise $10,000 to design and build a solar powered,
personal ground water pump and purifier for developing nations. He intends to
publish all of the plans on the Web as open hardware and start taking orders
from NGOs to install these pump-purifiers in villages around the world. Rather
than go through the process of receiving a grant, he believes that he can
raise the money faster through the Web. 
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
Support intent-based deposit contracts, which can be redeemed by the payee
in one bulk transfer.
        </li> 
      </ul>
    </section>
  </section>
 
  <section> 
    <h2>Content and Payment Metadata</h2> 
 
<p>Lars would like to ensure that the purchase process for a digital good
is streamlined as much as possible into the web browser that he has
created. When somebody uses the web browser, he would like to display a
"Buy" button in the address bar. The media details such as the title of the
work, the price and the details required to perform a swarming purchase
would be lifted from the web page.</p> 

<p>The purchase process would be as simple as the buyer clicking the Buy
button and watching a download progress dialog appear on the screen.
Account and payment details could be stored in the web browser to ease the
purchase process. Not bothering the person browsing for payment details
would be especially useful in scenarios where very small payments were
needed to access content.</p> 
 
    <section>
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>Content details should be able to be expressed in a Web page such
        that a user agent can extract the details for a piece of digital
        content.</li> 
     
        <li>All relevant payment details should be expressed in a Web page such
        that a user agent may purchase content after detecting the payment
        processing details on a page.</li> 
      </ul> 
    </section>
  </section>
 
  <section> 
    <h2>Multicast License Acquisition</h2> 

<p>The Association of Science Journalists Conference would like to present
a series of live keynotes by luminaries in their respective fields. The
presentations would be open to conference attendees or those that pay for a
virtual day pass for the conference. The license could be purchased
separately and then could be used to access a number of download sources. 
Remote access to journalists would be granted at a different payment rate 
than non-members.</p>

<p>It is important that a separation is made between the content license
and the download contract. The content license specifies usage and access
rights. The download contract specifies the download negotiables, such as
payment rate, speed and other details associated with the data stream. By
separating the two concerns, we can allow network specialization to occur
between those that would grant licenses for digital content and those that
would deliver digital content. Ensuring that both could operate
semi-autonomously would allow semi-independent optimization of market
variables.</p> 
  
    <section>
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>The system must be able to distinguish between licenses and contracts
        for data delivery. One should be able to purchase the license and then
        have the option of choosing their download source. Content licenses and
        data delivery contract should be able to be negotiated separately.</li> 
     
        <li>Licenses should be used to get access to data streams. Payment for
        licenses and payment for data should be separate concerns.</li> 
     
      </ul> 
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Licensing Access to Extra Content</h2>
    
<p>Luciano has purchased a song from an online music store. The band that 
created the song would like to give people that purchased any song from their
last album the chance to view their latest music videos and behind-the-scenes
footage.</p>

<p>Since Luciano's browser was used to make the purchase, it has a digitally
signed receipt of the sale. When he visits the band's website, it asks his
browser for a receipt that proves that he has purchased a song from their
latest album. The digital receipt is sent to the website, is verified, and
Luciano is allowed into the special VIP section of the band's website.</p>
    
    <section>
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The system should be able to express a digital receipt of 
        sale or license that can be verified by a 3rd party.</li>
        <li>The system must define a straight-forward mechanism for websites
        to request digital receipts of sale and for web browsers to answer
        with the proper receipt or license, after upload has been authorized 
        by the customer.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section> 
    <h2>Batching Micropayments</h2> 
 
<p>Penelope has completed her fourth book of photography. She would like to
charge a very small amount for her travel expenses and supplies but doesn't
want to make a living from the sale of her book. Penelope does, however,
want to make a number of contributions to charities that she would like to
support as well as give her fans the ability to contribute to their
favorite charities.</p> 

<p>Giving individuals on the network the ability to add optional payees to
licenses and contracts would enable payment models such as online tipping
for artists, donations to charity, and batched payments to a particular
initiative or cause to be made along-side the purchase.</p> 

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>Network participants must be allowed to add arbitrary accounts as
        payees for transactions.</li> 
     
        <li>A large number of payment accounts must be allowed to be batched with
        content transactions.</li> 
      </ul> 
    </section>
  </section>
 
  <section>
    <h2>App Stores</h2> 
 
<p>Werner owns an independent software development company. He would like
to provide his software application to a broad audience through his website
and accept payment from the same.</p>

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 

      <ul> 
        <li>

    <h2>Alternative Currencies</h2> 
 
    <p>
Rigo would like to create a local currency for his town, which is fairly poor
but contains a moderate population that volunteers their time at a number of
community-supported farms in the area. He would like to reward the area
citizens with time-banked credits that can be redeemed for food at local
businesses and restaurants.
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
Support alternative currencies and allow these currencies to be created

      <h2>Future Use Cases</h2>
      <p>
The following use cases were identified as important use cases, but have been
postponed until implementation lessons have been learned from the base 
PaySwarm specification.
      </p>

  <section> 
    <h2>Crowd-Sourcing Digital Distribution</h2> 
 
<p>Jane, who is an independent film maker, has just finished her
documentary and wishes to distribute it to a very large audience. She does
not have the resources to provide High-Definition streaming of her content
to her fans. She would also like to charge enough for the current
documentary in order to cover the production costs of the next documentary.
She could use BitTorrent to distribute her work, but it lacks the ability
to collect payment on her behalf. She would like to give some of the
proceeds of each sale to those that will help her distribute her
documentary.</p> 

<p>Ideally, Jane would register her work with a content clearinghouse. That
clearinghouse would provide the reference file which would be used to seed
the network. Once enough downloads have been performed, others on the
network could distribute the file in exchange for monetary compensation for
providing a download source.</p> 

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
 
      <ul> 
        <li>The system must be able to swarm file downloads from multiple
        sources.</li> 
     
        <li>Payment must be able to be divvied out among thousands of download
        sources.</li> 
     
        <li>Payment must be allowed to be made to arbitrary accounts on the
        network.</li> 
      </ul> 
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Ad-Based Content Payment</h2> 
 
<p>Joss directs and produces a number of excellent television shows. Over
the years, he has garnered a strong online following but doesn't have the
required numbers for a long television production run. He would like to
distribute his shows via the Web. Joss would like to partner with an
advertising network to provide audio and video advertisements to cover the
costs related to the production and distribution of his shows. In order to
do this, the system that he uses must be able to credit and debit payment
accounts accordingly whenever advertising is inserted into the content
stream.</p> 

<p>When a fan watches each episode, they can opt to pay for the episode in
full, pay for reduced advertisements, or request that advertisers cover the
entire cost of the show. Advertisers can choose to provide small payments
for anonymous advertisements, or larger payments if customers provide
advertising details and preferences to the advertisers.</p> 

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
 
      <ul> 
        <li>Network participants should be allowed to credit other accounts on
        the network. For example, buyers should be allowed to ask other network
        participants (advertisers) to partially cover their costs in exchange
        for the insertion of ads into the data stream.</li> 
     
        <li>Buyers should have the option of purchasing goods without
        advertising.</li> 
      </ul> 
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Price Negotiation</h2> 
 
<p>Gregor runs a fairly active high-definition movie download site. His
data transmission prices are high during peak hours and low during off-peak
hours. He would like to give his customers the option to negotiate for
lower download prices if they download their movies during the off-peak
times. He would also like to reserve the right to refuse a contract
re-negotiation attempt if he has not made a pre-set sales quota and even
raise his prices if it would make sense for his business.</p> 

<p>The ability to change prices based on market demand would enable a more
dynamic marketplace, leading to more competition between download
providers. Giving buyers the ability to re-negotiate terms of sale would
not only give them a sense of empowerment, but could eliminate bad pricing
behavior on the network, leading to overall market efficiencies.</p> 

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>The system should allow buyers and sellers to negotiate the data
        download prices associated with a particular download.</li> 
     
        <li>The system could allow buyers to negotiate the license details as
        well as the license price with a particular content creator.</li> 
      </ul> 
    </section>
  </section>

  <section> 
    <h2>Live Pricing Algorithms</h2> 
 
    <p>
A folk-musician in Siberia who records local throat-singing into mp3 or ogg 
vorbis files. He specifies: authorship; no content modification; free streaming 
of first 10% of content online; payment per download at sliding scale 
proportional to user-country's average yearly income per person; no downstream 
commercializing.
    </p>

    <section>
