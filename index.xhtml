The PaySwarm web platform is an open standard that enables web browsers and web 
devices to perform micropayments and copyright-aware, peer-to-peer digital 
media distribution. 
      </p>

        <h3>What does PaySwarm do?</h3>
        <p>
PaySwarm enables people that create digital content to distribute it through
the Web and receive payment directly from their fans and customers. It is
also designed to help fans and customers distribute digital content 
on behalf of the content creators in a way that is both legal and financially
beneficial to the creators, fans and customers. The technology is designed to 
be integrated directly into web devices, finally making legal digital content 
distribution a first-class citizen on the web.
        </p>
        <h3>What is an open web platform?</h3>
        <p>
An open web platform is a combination of technology that is patent-free, 
royalty-free, published in a free specification, using well-defined 
protocols and other open technologies. The combination of open technology
to accomplish a particular set of related tasks on the web defines an
"open web platform".
        </p>

        <h3>What is a Micropayment?</h3>
        <p>
The term micropayment is used loosely, as we don't want to bother the
customer to reach for their wallet every time they need to spend a
couple of cents, or even a couple of dollars. Micropayment in this case,
specifically refers to the ability to divvy royalties and payments in
increments of up to 1/10,000th of a cent to various royalty and payment
accounts as listed in the digital contracts.
        </p>

        <h3>Who can implement and use the technology?</h3>

        <p>
Anyone. The entire PaySwarm standard is implementable on a patent and 
royalty-free basis, just like HTTP, HTML 4.01 and 
Javascript. This means 
that anybody may implement any part of the system without worrying about 
technology licensing fees or patent suits from any of the participating W3C 
member companies.
        </p>
